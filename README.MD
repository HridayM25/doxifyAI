## Problem Statement
The lack of an automated solution for converting codebases into documentation poses challenges in terms of time, accuracy, and code comprehension. Documentation is often ignored by developers, especially in fast-building teams. However, this leads to severe technical debt. Since technical documentation is hard and existing tools are limited or expensive, there is a need for comprehensive automatic documentation generation.

## A Brief of the Prototype
### UML Diagrams
[Include UML diagrams here to visualize the architecture and design of the prototype.]

### Prototype Description
[Provide a brief description of the prototype, outlining its main features and functionality.]

## Tech Stack
List of technologies used to build the prototype:
- Frontend: Next.js
- Backend: FastAPI

## Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions
To clone and run the prototype for testing and analysis, follow the instructions below:

### Server Setup Guide

1. Set up a Python virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - For Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - For macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a folder named "model" and paste the required model files there.

5. To run the server, use the following command:
   ```
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

### Client Frontend Setup

1. Install Node.js dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the development server for the frontend:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
